= Engineering Design Process



== Preparation
(This section is background information, reading, and tasks for your preparation for session 2)

Study the four figures below that describe different views of the engineering design process.
The images link to the sources of the figures.


* [ ] Draw your own diagram that maps the engineering design process.
** What is the minimum number of "`blocks`" needed to capture the essence of the engineering design process?  Provide some justification for this number.
* [ ] How do you know when to move to the next step?

There are several formal processes that organizations follow.
This is usually described under the term _Systems Engineering_, which focuses on the larger scale organization of an entire project or system.
See <<nasa>> for one example document.
One reason for documenting this is so that everyone can use a common language when describing what they are working on and how it fits into the larger goals.


See *hw02* in https://classroom.google.com[Google Classroom^] for the instructions on turning in this work.

* *Ask:* What is the problem? How have others approached it? What are your constraints?

* *Imagine:* What are some solutions? Brainstorm ideas. Choose the best one.

* *Plan:* Draw a diagram. Make lists of materials you will need.

* *Create:* Follow your plan and create something. Test it out!

* *Improve:* What works? What doesn't? What could work better? Modify your design to make it better. Test it out!

== Class time
<<2-process-slides.adoc#,Slides>>

* Pair-up and share the three needs others have that you identified from https://classroom.google.com/c/MjcxODYwMzkxNTBa/a/MjcyMzI5NzIwNzVa/details[hw01^].
* As a pair, come up with 2 more.
* (each group shares their common theme or favorite)

=== Engineering Design Process
Pull out your process diagram and share it with your neighbor.

* Similarities
* **Differences**
