* Requirement vs. Implementation | What vs. How


* One thought
* Concise
* Positive statement
* Unambiguous
* Verifiable.  Inspection, analysis, demonstration, or test.

Terminology
* Shall - requirement
* Will - facts or declaration of purpose
* Should - goal


* *ize and *ly

Minimize use of:

* all
* any
* each
* every
* intent
* it
* these
* this



BEFORE writing requirements:

* Define: need, goals, and objectives
* Identify all stakeholders
* Identify drivers, constraints, dependencies
* Document assumptions


Eliciting requirements:

* Operational concepts.  A day in the life...
* User stories





// //////////////////////////////////////////////


* Give each requirement a unique identifier (QRA 3).
  This makes referring to other requirements simple and clear.
* Standardize your requirements document language (QRA 4).
  Shall, must, wi




=== Functional vs. non-functional

[horizontal]
Functional::  What the system *does*.  Use form "`The [device] _shall_ [verb] ...`"


[horizontal]
Non-functional:: Performance or constraints.  Use "`__must__`"



=== Implementation-neutral

* Clearly states what the system must _do_ and _not how_ it does it.

* Stated in terms of _external interfaces_, or behaviors that can be readily
_observed_ (therefore measured).



=== Verifiable

How can this requirement item be satisfied?

* 


=== Directives

Use of Tables or other references instead of embedding in English sentences.
